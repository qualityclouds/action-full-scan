## Built for Salesforce. Designed for GitHub.

<p><strong>Quality Clouds Build Check for Salesforce</strong> brings platform-specific governance directly into your GitHub workflow.</p>
<p>Whether you're managing metadata, enforcing org-wide naming standards, or safeguarding production from non-compliant changes, this GitHub Action delivers instant, actionable insights when a <strong> pull request </strong> is opened.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s the ultimate native pull request tool designed specifically for Salesforce teams, <strong>trusted by enterprise architects, release managers, and developers</strong> who care about getting it right before anything ships.</p>

**Because when code lives in GitHub but breaks in production, generic linters aren't enough.**

## What Is Quality Clouds?

<p><strong>Quality Clouds is the AI-powered governance layer</strong> built for enterprise platforms, starting with Salesforce.</p>
<p>We go beyond generic code checks by scanning platform-specific configurations, metadata, and code against your orgâ€™s quality and compliance KPIs.</p>
<p>Trusted by <strong>Fortune 500 teams</strong>, Quality Clouds helps developers, architects, and release managers catch issues early, enforce standards automatically, and ship with confidence- now directly from GitHub.</p>

## Why Your Linter Isnâ€™t Enough

<p>Most linters catch syntax and formatting issues. But:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They donâ€™t understand Salesforce.</li>
  <li>They miss metadata risks, naming violations, and org-specific rules that can break releases..</li>
</ul>

<p>Quality Clouds checks code, configuration, and compliance in one scan. Everything is aligned to your platformâ€™s standards.

Because clean code isnâ€™t enough. It has to be correct for your environment. </p>

## For Builders and Gatekeepers

<h3>For Developers</h3>
<p>Get <strong>instant feedback</strong> inside GitHub. See what needs fixing, why it matters, and how to resolve it before code review. Reduce back-and-forth, avoid late rework, and improve with every pull request.</p>

<h3>For Release Managers & Architects</h3>
<p>Enforce platform standards automatically while keeping teams moving. Gain <strong>visibility into every pull request</strong>, apply organization-specific rules, and ensure only compliant code moves forward.

This is how quality becomes part of the process, not a blocker at the end.
</p>



## Set It Up Once. Scan Every Pull Request.

<ol>
  <li>Install the Quality Clouds Build Check plugin from the GitHub Marketplace</li>
  <li>Add your API key to your YAML file</li>
  <li>Open a pull request and the scan runs automatically </li>
  <li>Review and approve directly in GitHub with clear, inline results</li>
</ol>

<p>No tool switching. No extra setup. Just instant feedback where your team already works.
</p>
